A step towards consilience

[The Role of Software Engineering in Scientific Discovery](The_Role_of_Software_Engineering_in_Scientific_Discovery.pdf)
is my response to a job interview question I was asked by
[The University of Cambridge](www.cam.ac.uk).
In short, I believe we can use software engineering practices
to unify our scientific knowledge.

This project is a first step towards that, focussing on the
boundary between atomic and quantum physics. Take a look at the
[Issues](https://github.com/TheJohnDixonEducationalInstitute/unatomic/issues)
page to see what I think needs to be done next, and please add
your own ideas there.
